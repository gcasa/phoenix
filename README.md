This is an attempt at an open source parser / compiler for swift written in ObjC.  I did this for an organization headed by
Aral Balkan a few years ago.  It is not finished, but it does serve as an example of a compiler writen in ObjC and
How to generate an AST.   The Swift team changed their syntax 4 times in one year so I gave up trying to follow them.  The 
code is here for posterity.
